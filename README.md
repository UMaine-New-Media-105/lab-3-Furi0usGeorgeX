Created a metroid out of a large ellipse, three small ellipses for "brains", an arc for the mouth, and two quads for the mandibles. Used "if else" statements to make metroid change color depending on X position. Then created function to draw metroid. Note that original metroid was drawn in center of canvas, so moving it to the left or up on the canvas requires negative X or Y values.
